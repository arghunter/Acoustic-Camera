# May 27th (trust)
I spent a while coming up with plans for the pcb and wiring of the acoustic camera. Not too much progress, mostly just the basics of daisy chaining,some work on the design and not much else.

**REMEMBER TO CHECK IF YOU NEED tO FLIP THE FPC CONNECTORS**

Ok today I designed the base microphone board schematic. They are pretty simple but this was my first time using kicad. Naturally this meant it took my a very long time to learn. Then I also struggled to find the correct parts and footprints and symbols. I got hte wrong micphone type initally and was so confused by the pin out. Eventually though I think I got it all sorted. I'll prolly make the layout tomorrow or later tonight. Also check fpc connectors.
